# Implementation Plan for Intelligent Automation Project

## Current State Analysis

The project has the following structure:
- Basic agent implementations that return simple string responses
- Empty pipeline files that need implementation
- A UserAgent that routes tasks to specific agents
- A main.py that demonstrates basic functionality

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Pipeline Implementation

Based on the documentation, we need to implement the following pipelines:

#### Email Pipeline
1. Email received
2. Processing via EmailAgent
3. Send to NLP/RAG
4. Defined action (reply, classification, forwarding)

#### Finance Pipeline
1. Document received
2. Extraction via DocumentAgent (OCR + NLP)
3. Validation with FinanceAgent
4. Register in database or spreadsheet
5. Automatic report generation

#### Scheduler Pipeline
1. Meeting request
2. Availability analysis via SchedulerAgent
3. Event creation in Google Calendar
4. Automatic invitation to user

#### Document Pipeline
1. Document received
2. Processing via DocumentAgent
3. Classification and storage
4. Metadata extraction

#### Support Pipeline
1. Support request received
2. Triage via SupportAgent
3. Automatic response or escalation
4. Ticket creation in system

### 2. Enhanced Features

#### Memory/Context Management
- Implement a context manager for agents
- Add conversation history tracking
- Implement persistent storage for context

#### Integration Capabilities
- Add Google Calendar integration for SchedulerAgent
- Add email sending capabilities for EmailAgent
- Add database connectivity for FinanceAgent
- Add file storage for DocumentAgent

#### Error Handling and Logging
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement logging framework
- Add retry mechanisms for external integrations

#### Configuration Management
- Create configuration files for different environments
- Add environment variable support
- Implement secure credential storage

### 3. Next Steps

1. Switch to Code mode to implement the pipeline logic
2. Enhance agent functionality with real processing capabilities
3. Add memory/context management system
4. Implement integration capabilities
5. Add error handling and logging
6. Create configuration management system
7. Implement testing framework
8. Document the implemented features
