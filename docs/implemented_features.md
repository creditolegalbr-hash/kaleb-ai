# Implemented Features Documentation

## Overview

This document provides documentation for the implemented features of the Intelligent Automation System. The system has been enhanced with several key components to create a robust, configurable, and intelligent automation platform.

## 1. Pipeline System

### Implemented Pipelines

The system now includes five fully implemented pipelines:

1. **Email Pipeline**
   - Processes email tasks through multiple steps
   - Analyzes content for priority and action determination
   - Automatically executes appropriate actions (reply, forward, archive, classify)

2. **Finance Pipeline**
   - Processes financial documents and data
   - Extracts key financial information
   - Validates data and stores in database
   - Generates automatic reports

3. **Scheduler Pipeline**
   - Handles meeting and event scheduling
   - Checks availability and creates calendar events
   - Sends automatic invitations to participants

4. **Document Pipeline**
   - Processes various document types
   - Classifies documents by type
   - Stores documents and extracts metadata

5. **Support Pipeline**
   - Handles support requests and tickets
   - Triage requests by priority and category
   - Automatically responds or escalates issues

### Pipeline Architecture

Each pipeline follows a consistent architecture:
- Base pipeline class with step management

## 9. Installation and Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyYAML for configuration management
- SQLite for database integration

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python src/main.py
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python tests/run_tests.py

# Run specific module tests
python tests/run_tests.py --module test_base_agent

# Run specific type tests
python tests/run_tests.py --type agents
```

## 10. Configuration

### Default Configuration

The system includes a default configuration file at `config/default.yaml` with the following structure:

```yaml
system:
  name: "Intelligent Automation System"
  version: "1.0.0"
  debug: false

agents:
  email: true
  finance: true
  scheduler: true
  document: true
  support: true

logging:
  level: "INFO"
  file_path: "logs/automation.log"
  max_bytes: 10485760  # 10MB
  backup_count: 5
  console_output: true

memory:
  context_manager:
    max_history: 100
  memory_store:
    type: "sqlite"
    path: "memory.db"

  email:
    enabled: true
    max_rate_limit: 50
  database:
    enabled: true
    max_connections: 10

    enabled: true
  support:
    enabled: true
```

## 11. API Usage

### Basic Agent Usage

```python
from agents.user_agent import UserAgent

# Initialize UserAgent
user_agent = UserAgent("MyAgent")

# Perform task with specific type
result = user_agent.perform_task("email", "Send report to client")

# Perform task with intelligent routing
result = user_agent.perform_intelligent_task("Please send an email to the client")
```

### Pipeline Usage

```python
from pipelines.email_pipeline import EmailPipeline

# Initialize pipeline
email_pipeline = EmailPipeline()

# Process task through pipeline
data = {"task": "Send urgent email to client"}
result = email_pipeline.process(data)
```

## 12. Extending the System
